# CSE 110 SP 24 Group 18 (Triton Financial Solutions) 
We are the **Triton Financial Solutions**, and this is our team's project: DevDiary, a JavaScript-based web tool that can help developers with organization of their thoughts, equipped with developer-centric functionalities and other general well-being tracking tools. The website features rich journaling features that encourage developers to write daily about their well-being and the progress they've made during the day. Both of which encourages further growth and mental stability in developers, which in our team's opinion is the key to success, even financially. The full list of functionalities are on the [additional README found on the source directory](src/README.md).

The technologies used in our application are simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the basic web-building tools that allow us to create a simple web app without worrying about backend details, or using tools with features we might not need.

The web app is mostly done functionally barring a couple of bugs which are [documented in this directory](admin/debugplans). Earlier on, we also had plans to implement a more visualized progress summary from all the journals within a short timespan, but we struggled on implementing it due to time constraints. 

## How to Use
There are two ways to open DevDiary:
- Clone this repo into your local device, and then run a live server of index.html found in the [src directory](src).
- OR, open the [deployed web's URL here](https://cse110-sp24-group18.github.io/cse110-sp24-group18/src/index.html).

General guide to access the functionalities:
- To select / delete past journals, click at them in the sidebar on the left. You cannot delete today's journal and new journal is automatically added each day.
- To sort the journals, simply adjust the calendar and the filters on top of the sidebar.
- To edit a journal, just click on the box under the title and the tools. To edit the title, double click on it, and click away to save.
- To open the widgets menu, click on the burger button found on the right side of the page, and click the widgets you like. All of their summary for the past 7 journals are in the summary menu, accessible to the button on the top right of the page.

How to use the documentation pipeline:
- Push to / merge branch to documentation branch.
- The pipeline will generate the files on jsdocsgenerated.
- Remerge branch to main.

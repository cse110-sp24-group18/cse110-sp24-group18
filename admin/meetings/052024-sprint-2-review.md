## Quick Review on Past Sprint
### Skeleton
* Formulated the design outline & wireframe through Figma
* Started with making basic skeleton code through Figma-to-code converter (HTML & CSS)
  --> Modified various parts to make it fit into our design 
* Made div and section elements for each widget and functionality
* Made interactable buttons for widgets
* Found the widget icon images through Google Fonts
* Chose the default font for the theme
* Enhance the interactability through extra modification in CSS

### Sleep Widget

### Emotion Widget
* Came up with rough design of the emotion widget: similar to slider widget from warm-up with a few UI changes to improve aesthetic
* ***Emotion widget design features:***
* --> selectable emotions laid out on a gauge similar to a speedometer
* --> a needle points to the emotion that the use selects
* --> cursor tracking function to update needle rotation and current emotion being hovered over
* --> custom emotion icons
* --> slimmer, sleeker design to fit on sidebar of dev journal
* began implementation by copying over original slider design from warm-up activity
* removed the slider, fixed container sizing as well as reorganized the widget containers from scratch
* implemented the emotion gauge, took lots of time messing with sizing and positioning before I eventually got it right
* drew the icons for each of the five emotions
* implemented the icons and new text font for each of the emotions
* added cursor tracking as well as event listeners to automatically change the selected emotion when the user hovered the cursor over it
* adjusted sizing and positioning until the widget matched our initial design

### Lines of Codes Widget
* Created A rough design of the lines of code widget: a simplistic design so that the user could input the lines of code per day.
*  ***Lines of Code Widget design features:***
*   --> Able to add or decrease lines of code written using the + and - buttons
*   --> Confirm button once the user is done inputtiing when he is done writing the lines of code for the day
*   --> User can also access the number directly and change it manually as it is a textbox (only accepts numbers).
*   --> Once confirm is clicked it switches to a celebration screen
*   --> Celebration screen displays message "Great Job" and has confetting falling (within the box for the widget).
*   Started the implementation by creating a box approximately the size of the widget popout for DevDiary
*   Added text " How many lines have you written today", along with the buttons confirm, +, and -
*   Added the Text box in the middle (which only takes in numbers)
*   Centered everything and used the proper colors for our theme, as well as the proper fonts and font sizes
*   Added functionality to the buttons (so that + and - will change the number) and confirm brings it to a new screen
*   Added a hover effect when hovering over the buttons
*   Created the conform screen with a new message "Great Job"
*   Added confetti so that it only falls within the widget box
*   Made final adjustments to to centering.

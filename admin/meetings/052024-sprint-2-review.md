## Quick Review on Past Sprint
### Skeleton

### Sleep Widget

### Emotion Widget
* Came up with rough design of the emotion widget: similar to slider widget from warm-up with a few UI changes to improve aesthetic
* ***Emotion widget design features:***
* --> selectable emotions laid out on a gauge similar to a speedometer
* --> a needle points to the emotion that the use selects
* --> cursor tracking function to update needle rotation and current emotion being hovered over
* --> custom emotion icons
* --> slimmer, sleeker design to fit on sidebar of dev journal
* began implementation by copying over original slider design from warm-up activity
* removed the slider, fixed container sizing as well as reorganized the widget containers from scratch
* implemented the emotion gauge, took lots of time messing with sizing and positioning before I eventually got it right
* drew the icons for each of the five emotions
* implemented the icons and new text font for each of the emotions
* added cursor tracking as well as event listeners to automatically change the selected emotion when the user hovered the cursor over it
* adjusted sizing and positioning until the widget matched our initial design

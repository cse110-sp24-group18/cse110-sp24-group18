# Sprint 1 Review Meeting

## Notes for what to add
**For "Notes On What To Do Next Time"**: There should be a lot more demo-ing towards the project in these meetings. But since this is a warmup, focus more on what was learned from the project (skill and execution of WebDev wise). What did you learn from the warmup in this regard? Any thing that is really good for the development (resources, great idea, etc)? Any thing that's related to web that's causing trouble (lack of info, lack of idea, lack of assignments, etc)?

Important thing to keep in mind: this review is supposed to quality control the project itself (not the team).

## Quick Review on Past Sprint
### Slider Widget
- Details the process (from ideas, planning, wireframing, code, testing, documentation / demoing, and everything in between)

### Task List Widget
- Details the process (from ideas, planning, wireframing, code, testing, documentation / demoing, and everything in between)
- Came together as a group to discuss ideas for basic overview/required features
- Took inspiration from some other tasklists
- Planning and wireframing done through hand drawn diagrams then through more finalized computer drawn diagrams
- Wrote the codebase for the task list
- Documented everything
- Tested everything
- Fixed the code based on the tests
- Implemented extra guards for vulnerabilities revealed by tests
- Created demo video
- Documented design process

## Notes On What To Do Next Time
- Use whiteboard more to draw up ideas, planning, and research.
- Utilize the Github tools more efficiently.
- Plant to split the works better between components of the product.
- Use branching systems of Github more. Like discussed with the TA before, we should have one branch for each member. This is to keep the branches ahead.
- Write on the documentations while doing the codes.
- Write the codes in a way so then it's modular, especially the base of the code (so everyone can work on it). It was hard to integrate several pieces of work together.

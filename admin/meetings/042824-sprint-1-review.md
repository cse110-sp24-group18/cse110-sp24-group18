## Pre-meeting note
Pre-meeting note: There should be a lot more demo-ing towards the project in these meetings. But since this is a warmup, maybe focus more on what was learned from the project (skill and execution of WebDev wise). What did you learn from the warmup in this regard? Any thing that is really good for the development (resources, great idea, etc)? Any thing that's related to web that's causing trouble (lack of info, lack of idea, lack of assignments, etc)?

Importantly, this review is supposed to quality control the project itself (not the team).

# Sprint 1 Review Meeting

## Notes for what to add
**For "Notes On What To Do Next Time"**: There should be a lot more demo-ing towards the project in these meetings. But since this is a warmup, focus more on what was learned from the project (skill and execution of WebDev wise). What did you learn from the warmup in this regard? Any thing that is really good for the development (resources, great idea, etc)? Any thing that's related to web that's causing trouble (lack of info, lack of idea, lack of assignments, etc)?

Important thing to keep in mind: this review is supposed to quality control the project itself (not the team).

## Quick Review on Past Sprint
### Slider Widget
- Met on Monday afternoon at the beginning of the week to plan and design the Slider widget
- Discussed the Slider widget demonstrated by Prof. Powell; what ideas we should use in our Slider and what new ideas we wanted to implement
- Considered all aspects of the Slider (UI, functionality, ease of use, quality of life) from the user's perspective and recorded what we thought would work best from that POV
- Created the general wireframe for the Slider on a whiteboard, adding and subtracting features until we had a design we all liked
- Divided the work between HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and documentation, assigning each team member to a respective aspect of the project
- Wrote the general code to get the Slider working (mostly functionality, not much in terms of UI or new features)
- Discussed the baseline implementation of the Slider, decided we were ready to continue with current version
- Implemented new features such as feeling messages, background colors, and money falling from the top of the screen
- Began testing process
- Fixed a display bug so that the widget correctly responds to any size screen it is displayed on
- Documented design process, created a demo video for the widget and its design process

### Task List Widget
- Came together as a group to discuss ideas for basic overview/required features
- Took inspiration from some other tasklists
- Planning and wireframing done through hand drawn diagrams then through more finalized computer drawn diagrams
- Wrote the codebase for the task list
- Documented everything
- Tested everything
- Fixed the code based on the tests
- Implemented extra guards for vulnerabilities revealed by tests
- Created demo video
- Documented design process

## Notes On What To Do Next Time
- Use whiteboard more to draw up ideas, planning, and research.
- Utilize the Github tools more efficiently, especially issues so we know what to do beforehand and branching so there's no merge conflicts.
- Plant to split the works better between components of the product.
- Use branching systems of Github more. Like discussed with the TA before, we should have one branch for each member. This is to keep the branches ahead.
- Write on the documentations while doing the codes.
- Write the codes in a way so then it's modular, especially the base of the code (so everyone can work on it). It was hard to integrate several pieces of work together.

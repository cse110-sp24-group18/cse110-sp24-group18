## Notes On What To Do Next Time
- Use whiteboard more to draw up ideas, planning, and research.
- Utilize the Github tools more efficiently.
- Plant to split the works better between components of the product.
- Use branching systems of Github more. Like discussed with the TA before, we should have one branch for each member. This is to keep the branches ahead.
- Write on the documentations while doing the codes.
- Write the codes in a way so then it's modular (so everyone can work on it). It was hard to integrate several pieces of work together.

## Pre-meeting note
Pre-meeting note: There should be a lot more demo-ing towards the project in these meetings. But since this is a warmup, maybe focus more on what was learned from the project (skill and execution of WebDev wise). What did you learn from the warmup in this regard? Any thing that is really good for the development (resources, great idea, etc)? Any thing that's related to web that's causing trouble (lack of info, lack of idea, lack of assignments, etc)?

Importantly, this review is supposed to quality control the project itself (not the team).

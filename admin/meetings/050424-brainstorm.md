__Project theme: "Developer Journal", "Budget App for Developers"__

__Problem we're solving: Financial Problems of Developers__

__Features a system would need to address it:__

Phase 1 (Essentials):
- Process of developing to refer back to
- Trial and errors tracking
- Sectioning based on idea / project / frame work
- Developing journals: what went well, what was completed, daily journaling
- Text styling
- Rendering
- Organization system for all notes (Ability to look at old diaries / entries, foldered)
- Dark mode

Phase 2 (Extra features):
- User login / signup
- Collaboration: join groups / project with other developers
- Theme customizations

Phase 3 (Group personalization for budgeting):
- Budgeting / Finance for the developers in the group (spending and such of the group)
- Allocate budget to subteams / specific features / etc
- Expenditure per month on a specific database
- Group chat log / announcements

__Clarify definitions and requirements:__
- Database of some kind would be used (MongoDB, SQL, etc)


__Users and their expectations:__
- Individuals and groups of developers
- They expect easy to use app to organize their work and easily manage their budgets so that their developing process is more efficiently done.

__App's theme or mood:__
- Professional and minimalistic
- Customized buttons / logos / etc
- Dark mode

__Survey the competition__
- Github
- Slack
- Notetaking apps like OneNote

Although other apps mentioned above fulfill somewhat similar purposes as our apps, our project encompasses a more specific and focused target audience being the organization and budget managing of developers. It is also a lot more emphasized around groups and finance, unlike what we assume is more common with other teams.

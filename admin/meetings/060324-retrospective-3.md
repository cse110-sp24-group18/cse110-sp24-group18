## What Went Well For The Team
- We managed to finish the code in the end.
- In-person coding sprint was good.
- The unit testings making process did pretty smoothly.
- The project taught a lot about working in groups and with web developing.

## What Didn't Go As Well For The Team
- We had to cut certain features because of time or complexity constraints.
- We don't have a unified coding style: how scripts create html elements and such.
- We have a very short amount of times for all of the details that need to be done like coding styles.
- Little resources for CI/CD pipelines, meaning finishing it took time, making it less effective.

## What We Should Do More / Try Next Time As a Team
- Code planning should be more extensive and clearer
- Skeleton code should've been done a lot faster and finished first before all of the widgets put in.
- We should've utilized the CI/CD pipeline a lot better instead of spamming it at the end.
- We should've had a centralized UI design from the beginning.

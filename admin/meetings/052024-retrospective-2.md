## What Went Well For The Team
- The planning meeting on Monday was really good because the directions of things are pretty clear.
- Planning and distributing the tasks were pretty good.
- Everyone was responsive on Slack.
- Feedbacks back and forth for finished prototypes are often done in the Slack chats.
- In person meetings where everyone just work on their tasks in the same room is really good for quick feedbacks and helps.
- The team in general worked very rapidly as we are finishing our products way faster than the canvas / course-given products.

## What Didn't Go As Well For The Team
- Some of the members heavily underestimated how much time it would take to finish some tasks.
- Designs of what to make are not clear enough, leading to confusion of directions on what members should exactly make.
- UI designs often keep changing without clearly detailed planning.
- Distribution of works are pretty unbalanced with some members working way more than the others.

## What We Should Do More / Try Next Time As a Team
- Members should be enforced / be expected to respect the agreed-upon deadlines more. Furthermore, some needs to show up more to the meetings.
- The team should do more planning ahead that includes considering all of the schedules.
- Dedicated channels for guidelines where only leaders can talk and is dedicated for the project would be good so that everyone can refer to a channel for what to make.
- A new, "updated", branch would be good so that everyone can see clearly which skeleton code / UI is the most recent.
- Adding to the last point, a github action that announces changes to this branch to a slack channel would be helpful.

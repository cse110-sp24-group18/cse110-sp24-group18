# Retrospective 1

## Notes for what to add
Retrospective is about quality control for the team, how it's structured, run, and not about the project itself.
- Any thing about the structure and how the tasks are split?
- Any thing about the process (meeting, assigning of tasks, submissions, communications, etc)?
- Any other thing to note?

From these, put in your input in all of the sections, if you have any. This can be informal, or something specific like "I wished we did more meeting" or anything of sort.

## What Went Well For The Team
- Communication was really smooth, each member is very responsive.
- The organization by the leadership (especially Ishika) was very helpful. All of the templates for each member is already made so everyone can easily finish their jobs.
- The team's atmosphere was great. Everyone's ideas are accepted / considered and everyone got along.

## What Didn't Go As Well For The Team
- The project is small so the work splitting isn't as easy.
- Time isn't fair for a lot of the team members. Both because of time constraints of this project being only one week, and that some members are busier than the others in the week.
- Some of the members think that we could've also done the Calendar widget as well.
- The splitting of the work is imbalance as Michael does a lot more than the other. This is related to the assignment being very short and so it's not easily divisible. This is also compounded by the fact that JavaScript, HTML, and CSS are so tied together the work can't be split along the three.
- Time constraints that make everything has to be done last minute.

## What We Should Do More / Try Next Time As a Team
- Next time, don't split the works between JavaScript / HTML / CSS, but instead by features.
- Don't leave the work until last minute.
- Keep going with the good and responsive communication within the team.
- In the event that some members are more busy than the others during the week, they should inform everyone and remain responsive communication-wise; they need to still be in the loop with what's being worked on.

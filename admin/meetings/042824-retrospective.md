## Pre meeting note
Retrospective is about quality control for the team, how it's structured, run, and not about the project itself.

- Any thing about the structure and how the tasks are split?
- Any thing about the process (meeting, assigning of tasks, submissions, communications, etc)?
- Any other thing to note?

## Communication and Expectations
1. The main communication method will be through Slack; the announcement channel will be the primary meeting and scheduling information hub, general channel will be for the discussions.
2. Each member is required to reply to messages and announcements within **24 hours** for smooth and effective communication. **In the event of regular inactivity** or two continuous missed messages/meetings without an explanation, it will count as a strike ([see below](#rule-violations)).
3. As a consequence of clause 2, each member is expected to have their Slack notification on.

## Scheduled Meetings
1. In-person / Online meeting will be **mandatory every week**.
2. The current regular, and agreed upon, schedule for the weekly meeting is Monday, 3:00 - 4:30 PM (might be extended to 5:00 PM if need be). This schedule might be changed depending on the circumstances, namely the deadline of the upcoming assignments.
3. In addition, there might be extra meetings when time needs be. Although these will be mandatory, the punishment will not be as enforced if any member has a good reason to not be able to attend.
4. Team members who are unable to attend an upcoming meeting due to some serious reasons will have to notify one of the team leads well in advance (**before** the meeting). We understand that unforeseen circumstances may arise, and that is why _communication is key_. Feel free to reach out to us, and together we can find a solution!

## General Responsibilities and Commitments
Each member is expected to:
- Actively participate and contribute to each assignment, especially to their assigned role of the assignment.
- Communicate any issues or concerns promptly through Slack or in person during a meeting.
- Collaborate with other team members and assist one another.
- Conduct oneself respectfully towards other team members.
- Complete tasks in a timely manner to avoid slowing down the progress of the group.

## Structure
1. The group will be divided into sub-teams to ensure higher productivity and leveraging each individualâ€™s unique strengths and skillsets.
2. Sub-teams will be assigned specific tasks, and each sub-team will closely collaborate with one another to achieve overall project goals.
3. Each sub-team's representative is expected to be in close communication with both team leads.
4. The roles, at time of writing, are to be decided to better represent what the projects and assignments require.

## Rule Violations
1. A strike is counted as any act that goes against the rules stated. In most cases these will be, but not limited to:
- Missing a meeting without prior explanation
- Inactivity in Slack as described above
- Non-compliance with the general responsibilities as stated above
2. Each team member will be allowed to have two strikes before they will be in violation of the team guidelines. In case a team member violates the guideline by having two strikes, this issue will be discussed with the TA.
3. In special occurences like unforeseen circumstances or reasons, more than two strikes _might_ be allowed. However, just as stated before, good communication and reasoning well in advance is mandatory for this clause to take place.

## Signature
For the success of the team, I hereby agree to all of the rules and have noted the consequences of not complying with the rule stated above.

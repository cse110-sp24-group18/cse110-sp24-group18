# Triton Financial Solutions (Group 18)
Hi! We are the **Triton Financial Solutions**, and we are from Group 18 of CSE 110 Spring 2024.

## Our Brand


## Our Goals and Values
As you have probably already guessed from our name, our team focuses mainly on the financial aspect and how implementing our CS knowledge can help in that department. We believe that the main goal of pursueing education is ultimately the ability for us to give to the community and making the world a better place. As such, since we realize that financial problems are one of the most troubling issue right now, no less in UCSD, we think that it's a good place to start. We are committed to produce a useful product that can help tackle this problem, and we're honored to have this idea realized in the form of a project for CSE 110 class with all of the resources available for us.

Hi! My name is **Bernico**, and I am a second year CS Major at Revelle College. I came from Indonesia, and the way to pronounce my name is more akin to _bear-nee-koh_. My favorite programming language is Python, although my favorite branch of CS that I would love to work in is Game Developing.

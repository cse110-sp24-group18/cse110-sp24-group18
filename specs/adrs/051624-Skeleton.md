# Skeleton Codes UI Designs

## Context and Problem Statement

There were different ways in order for the code to be able to pop up containers (the widgets). We decided to use the method of the buttons being the same classes, carrying varied data-targets which toggles the display of the containers to flex (the default being none).

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* The previous method of moving the container from a hidden place is prone to problems when the user zooms out a lot.

## Considered Options

* Creating a new container in the javascript function. This might be important when there are issues with resetting or animations, but because this is a lot more complex, it's not used as of now.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Using the display:none method for the widgets", because it's the most simplistic which doesn't have any issue right now.

# UI Design Change and New Wireframes

## Context and Problem Statement

 After the meeting with our TA, we realized that our UI design is not the strongest. Hence, the team has decided to work on a better wireframe and design for the final project.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* Weak UI design
* Other teams are more likely to vote for a project with better UI than a project with more complex features

## Considered Options

* Revision of UI: Have another meeting with a few members from the team who would be willing to work on these changes.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Revision of UI", because that's the only reasonable option.

## More Information
* Meeting will take place in Week 7 to finalize the wireframes and UI design of our app.

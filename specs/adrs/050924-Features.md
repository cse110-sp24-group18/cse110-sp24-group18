# UI Design Change and New Wireframes

## Context and Problem Statement

{Describe the context and problem statement, e.g., in free form using two to three sentences or in the form of an illustrative story.
 You may want to articulate the problem in form of a question and add links to collaboration boards or issue management systems.}

 After the meeting with our TA, we realized that our UI design is not the strongest. Hence, the team has decided to work on a better wireframe and design for the final project.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* Weak UI design
* Other teams are more likely to vote for a project with better UI than a project with more complex features

## Considered Options

* Revision of UI: Have another meeting with a few members from the team who would be willing to work on these changes.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Revision of UI", because
{justification. e.g., only option, which meets k.o. criterion decision driver | which resolves force {force} | â€¦ | comes out best (see below)}.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## More Information
* Meeting will take place in Week 7 to finalize the wireframes and UI design of our app.

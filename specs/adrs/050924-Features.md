# Removal of Phase 3 (features)

## Context and Problem Statement

In our plan for the final project, we had divided all the features into 3 phases. Following is the description for each:
* Phase 1: All basic features of a journal
* Phase 2: Collbaorative features, options to join a group/team
* Phase 3: Budgeting and financing features to track the expenses of each project

However, we realized that the complexity fo our app should not be our priority. Hence, we have decided to remove phase 3 of development entirely.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
## Decision Drivers

* Time constraints
* Quality of the entire project will go down if we try doing too much

## Considered Options

* Removal of Phase 3
* Updating Phase 3
  

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Removal of Phase 3", because
there's nothing much you can change in that phase, it mainly focusing on one thing. Hence, removing it would be the best option.

<!-- This is an optional element. Feel free to remove. -->
### Consequences

* Good, because we will get more time to implement other things and also improvise our UI.
* Bad, because we are removing one unique feature our app had.

# Lines Of Code Widget Solution

## Context and Problem Statement
After the meeting on 5/13 our group decided to create a lines of code widget, so that it will have the technical aspect required in the Software Developers Diary.

## Decision Drivers

* To create a technical software related widget to DevDiary
* Add a user friendly widget with good UI design

## Considered Options

* Create a simplistic Widget for Lines of Code with pleasant UI
* Create a more feature heavy Widget for Lines of Code

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: Option 1 \
We chose option 1, as we want the widget to be as simplistic as possible. We want it to be intuitive for the user, and if we did option 2, it might be too many features many of them unused and would possibly bog down the widget and make the use of the widget daunting to new users. 
### Consequences

* Good, because the simplisitic UI for the widget will be intuitive, and be able to perform its task effectively. 
* Bad, because simplistic design and use allows for limited features.

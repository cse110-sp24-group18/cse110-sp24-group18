# {short title of solved problem and solution}

## Context and Problem Statement

Practically, the designs were accepted from the start of the UI designing / wireframe. However, designing the date picker's looks gave a bit of a dylemma considering the fact that the default dropdown menu isn't very appealing, while getting a full on custom designs seemed to need a lot of efforts we couldn't afford the time of. This especially is going to cause issues integrating it with the skeleton code.

## Decision Drivers

* The default dropdown menu isn't very appealing.
* A full custom design isn't feasible.

## Considered Options

* Allocating more time in order to actually implement the full custom design.
* Try a middle-ground with only using CSS to design it.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Try a middle-ground with only using CSS to design it.", because
it seems to be the option that is time-efficient, yet still produces a relatively good quality product.

### Other Option: Allocating more time in order to actually implement the full custom design.

Our other option of just working more on it in order to have a fully custom design.

* Good, because it shows more work and results in a better overall product.
* Bad, because it will take a lot longer for seemingly little benefit.
* Bad, because it complicates the integration process to the main code.

## More Information

The design was supposed to be done by Sarena. However, due to personal issues, the design was instead done by the UI / skeleton code team.
